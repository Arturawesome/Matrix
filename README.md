# Matrix Operations Application

## Overview
Name: **Matrix Operations Application**
Author: **Artur D. Nasyrov**
Aim: training project to deepen knowledge in modern C++ and Qt framework development. 
Description: The application allows users to input matrices, perform operations on them, and visualize the results interactively.

## Technologies Used
- **Qt6**: For GUI development.
- **CMake**: For project build system and dependency management.
- **Modern C++ (C++17)**: For core application logic.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: To design a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Templates and STL**: For efficient and reusable code.

## Skills and Concepts Learned
- **Qt6 Basics**: Understanding of Qt signals, slots, layouts, and widgets.
- **CMake Fundamentals**: Setting up projects, managing dependencies, and handling Qt-specific features like `AUTOUIC` and `AUTOMOC`.
- **Graphical User Interface Design**: Building intuitive user interfaces with Qt Designer and `mainwindow.ui`.
- **Matrix Operations**: Implementing matrix manipulations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and determinant calculation.
- **Error Handling**: Managing user input and ensuring robust application behavior.

## Description
The **Matrix Operations Application** provides an interactive platform to:
1. Input the number of matrices for operations.
2. Define matrix dimensions and elements.
3. Perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and determinant computation.
4. Display results dynamically in the GUI.


## Features
- Interactive input fields for specifying matrix dimensions and values.
- Dropdown options for selecting matrix operations.
- Real-time computation and result display.
- Error handling for invalid matrix inputs.
- Modular code structure for easy extension and maintenance.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Qt6 Framework**
- **CMake 3.10 or later**
- **C++17 Compiler**


## Future Improvements
- Add support for advanced matrix operations (e.g., eigenvalues, inverses).
- Include unit tests for matrix functions.
- Improve the user interface for better usability.
- Add localization support for multiple languages.
